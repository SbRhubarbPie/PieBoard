  Started going through lots of videos and threads to find ideas for parts and general ideas of what I might want to do for design. I found some cool keycaps that look like a sunset and some decent switches, as well as decided on going for a 100% keyboard even if it may be more challenging because I like my numpad.

  Started going through tutorials and more threads to find a suitable micro controller. I ended up going into a rabbit hole on directly soldering the chip onto the pcb and all the curcuits I would need for that. I watched tons of videos but I really just lack the experience needed to solder and design the extra curcuits with this approach so I decided on using a devboard, although I did learn a lot from the research. I ended up settling on the STM32F411 "blackpill" because I need an excessive amount of ports to handle a 100% keyboard matrix with RGB. I looked into the general design of keyboards to get an idea of how I would want to CAD the parts out to be printed in parts, which seems doable but will take some time.

  I am revisiting what microcontroller to pick because the black pill is very expensive, however I am having a hard time finding anything with almost all gpios broken out. I found the rp2040 stamp, which is really nice and I might go with instead, it is still a little expensive because of shipping but a lot better than the black pill.
